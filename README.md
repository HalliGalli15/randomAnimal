# RandomAnimal

This project is all about learning to use API's and angular as a API-Client. Routing between different pages and using multiple API's via Services. The Doom structure is like this: Componends, Services and Interfaces.

They are three different apis who are used in this project.
- Github api (https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
- OpenCatApi (https://docs.thecatapi.com/)
- OpenDogApi (https://docs.thedogapi.com/)

Tests and Lint are disabled/removed from this project, to keep it clean and simple.
